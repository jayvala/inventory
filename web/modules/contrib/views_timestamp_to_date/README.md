# Views Timestamp to Date

This module creates a Views field handler that enables you output a formatted
date given a field that produces a timestamp.

## Instructions

After you enable this module (you may need to run cron/clear caches):
1) Create/edit your view.
2) Add one or more fields that outputs a timestamp.
3) Add the "Global: Timestamp to Date Field" field created by this module.
4) In Timestamp to Date Field's settings, select the field that contains the timestamp.
5) Adjust the Timestamp to Date Field format as you would like.

That's it!
